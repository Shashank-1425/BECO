# BECO DA TASK

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting target variables using machine learning models. The objective is to develop a regression model that achieves strong performance metrics, particularly focusing on the R² score to evaluate model accuracy.

The tasks covered:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model building and evaluation
- Analysis of model performance and suggestions for improvements

Project Structure
- Data Preprocessing:  
  Handled missing values, feature engineering, and scaling where required.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
  Visualized distributions, correlations, and important trends in the dataset.

- Model Building:  
  Built a regression model (Linear Regression and others if applicable).  
  Evaluated model performance using R² Score and other metrics.

- Model Evaluation:  
  Identified differences in R² scores between models due to feature selection, train-test split variability, or preprocessing differences.

Key Results
- Model Performance:
  - Achieved an R² score of approximately 0.33.
  - Identified that preprocessing steps and feature selection greatly impacted R² score variability.
  
- Insights:
  - Better feature engineering and consistent data splitting strategies can stabilize and improve model performance.
  


Future Work
- Improve feature engineering for better model generalization.
- Explore hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Ridge, Lasso Regression).
- Use cross-validation to get more stable R² estimates.
- Try ensemble methods like Random Forest Regressor or Gradient Boosting.
